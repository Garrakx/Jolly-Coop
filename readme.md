# Description #
- Configure the input for the players in the vanilla options menu. 
	**Careful, it only matters the player NUMBER (player1, player3, etc) you are, regardeless of your color/character!**
- Choose how many players you want to play with (1 - 4) on the top left corner of config menu 
- To point, hold the point button and choose the direction with arrow keys/joystick.
- If you point any object / creature an arrow will appear above it.
- Scavengers will look at pointed objects.
- Access configuration in the options menu -> config mod.
- To cycle the camera between players, tap the map button.
- All players need to sleep together to survive a cycle.
- To grab a player, they will need to crouch first.
- To carry a player on your back first grab the player and then hold the grab button.
- To release a player just hold grab. If you are being carry you can jump to hop off.
- If one of the players dies, the other ones will have to carry them to the shelter.
- The food bar is shared by all players.
- Holding jump while pointing will express more emphasis.
- Pup / old mode is mostly cosmetic. 
- Pups will have a hard time grabbing into high poles, and old slugcats will have problems standing on poles/sliding.
- Old mode is just a joke.
- Hold down anywhere to do a sleeping emote.

*NEW IN 1.6*
- After activating Easy Mode, only one player needs to reach the shelter to survive the cycle.
- You can edit the Player name by editing the jollyPlayerName.json file you will find in the same folder as the .exe.
